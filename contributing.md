Because of our policy of “pull request against Lightbend Scala first” the primary route to contributing to Typelevel Scala is by contributing to Lightbend Scala. The Lightbend Scala team have made huge advances in lowering the barrier to participation in compiler development recently, in large part due to a new SBT-based build, and [helpful documentation](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/README.md) — the Scala distribution is now an SBT project which you can expect to work on in much the same way as any other github hosted FLOSS Scala project. [Miles Sabin](https://github.com/milessabin) has provided a write up (now slightly outdated) of the process [here](http://milessabin.com/blog/2016/05/13/scalac-hacking/).

Because a pull request against [scala/scala](https://github.com/scala/scala) is the first step, to contribute you will need to sign the [Scala CLA](http://www.lightbend.com/contribute/cla/scala) and be willing to make your contributions under the [Scala License](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/doc/LICENSE.md). Typelevel is strongly in favour of the currently Scala license/CLA (which requires contributors to grant a patent license but does not grant one in return) being replaced by the Apache 2.0 [license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and [ICLA](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt) (which both requires and grants a patent license) as soon as is feasible. If you would like to contribute but are unable to sign the CLA please raise this issue on the [Lightbend](https://gitter.im/scala/contributors) and [Typelevel](https://gitter.im/typelevel/scala) gitter channels.

## Community

Topics specific to Typelevel Scala are discussed on its [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/typelevel/scala). Scala compiler development is discussed on the [scala/contributors gitter channel](https://gitter.im/scala/contributors).

People are expected to follow the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html) when discussing Typelevel Scala on the Github page, Gitter channel, or other venues.

We hope that our community will be respectful, helpful, and kind. If you find yourself embroiled in a situation that becomes heated, or that fails to live up to our expectations, you should disengage and contact one of the [project maintainers](http://typelevel.org/scala/#maintainers) in private. We hope to avoid letting minor aggressions and misunderstandings escalate into larger problems.

If you are being harassed, please contact one of [us](http://typelevel.org/scala/#maintainers) immediately so that we can support you.

* Erik Osheim ([@non](https://github.com/non))
