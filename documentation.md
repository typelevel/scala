So you want to work in the Typelevel compiler, but don't know where to start? Don't worry, you have come to the right place.

* [Project folder structure](/documentation/project_structure)
* [Basic structure of the Scala Compiler](/documentation/basic_structure)
* [How to test your fix or feature](/documentation/testing_compiler)
* [Using your own compiler](/documentation/using_your_own)

If you are looking at more technical aspects of the compiler, you may want to read about:

* [Compiler phases](/documentation/phases)
* [Trees](/documentation/trees)
* [Symbols](/documentation/symbols)
* [Types](/documentation/types)
* [How to profile the compiler](/documentation/profiling_compiler)

## Additional information

Some material that may help you in the journey to the core of Scala compiler:

* [Hacking on scalac â€” 0 to PR in an hour](https://milessabin.com/blog/2016/05/13/scalac-hacking/) a blog post by [Miles Sabin](https://github.com/milessabin) and an excellent introduction to working with the Scala compiler

* [A Deep Dive into Scalac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2742pWdUm6c) by Chris Birchall, his talk at ScalaWorld 2015 and a good description of the compiler itself.
