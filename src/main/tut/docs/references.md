We wrote this documentation from our experience on reading, developing, or debugging, some forked 
variants of the Scala compiler. 

We would like to thank here those who have written, or given talks, about the inner workings and 
structure of the Scala Compiler and its variants. 

### Video presentations

* Chris Birchall, [A Deep Dive into Scalac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2742pWdUm6c). 
  In Scala World, Penrith (UK), September 2015. This a good description of the compiler itself.

### Web logs

* [Miles Sabin](https://github.com/milessabin), [Hacking on scalac â€” 0 to PR in an hour](https://milessabin.com/blog/2016/05/13/scalac-hacking/). An excellent introduction to working with the Scala compiler.
