The description part is intended as a guide for programmers seeking to understand the structure,
and operation of the compiler, and its implementation. Some of its aspects are the following ones:

Some of these contents provide an overview of the compiler code and operation, and the organisation of 
the project. 

* [Basic structure of the Scala Compiler](./basic_structure.html)
* [Project folder structure](./project_structure.html)
* [Compiler phases](./phases.html)

Some contents are specifically dedicated to the key data structures in the compiler that 
represents elements of the Scala language. 

* [Trees](./trees.html)
* [Symbols](./symbols.html)
* [Types](./types.html)

If you want to contribute, you can easily do so via edit links present at the bottom of the pages [like this one](https://github.com/typelevel/scala/edit/typelevel-readme/src/main/tut/docs/index.md)
