This page describes the Scala [AST]() and its implementation within the Scala compiler code. 

The AST is designed to capture the syntactic constructs of the Scala Programming Language, 
as described in the [language specification](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/13-syntax-summary.html). The implementation of the Tree is encoded in [this file](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.13.x/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/Trees.scala) 

The official documentation of the compiler has a great section giving more details on  [Trees](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/reflection/symbols-trees-types.html)/
