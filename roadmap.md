The following are high priority issues for Typelevel projects on which progress is likely to be made in 2016,

* Partial type application.
* Multiple implicit parameter blocks.
* Improved compile times for inductive implicits.
* Improved control over implicit prioritization.
* Improved error reporting for implicit resolution failures.
* GADT and singleton type bugfixes.
* Literal syntax for Byte and Short types.
* Support for alternative `scala.Predef`.

In accordance with the policy for inclusion contributions on these issues will be made as pull requests against Lightbend Scala in the first instance.
